# What to install
Install anaconda python 3.6 then install all the libraries in the next section.

https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

If you don't want to take up that much space you can instead install [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) and manually install all the above packages but we recommend you just install all of anaconda.

You are also welcome to use whatever python 3.x distribution you want and install the packages with pip, again, not recommended.

# What You'll need
Throughout this class we will be teaching you aspects of various scientific and numerical computing libraries in Python and using them to explore 

We will use the following libraries:
- [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) - library for scientific computing
- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) - for numerical computing (basis of all the other libraries here)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - plotting library
- [Jupyter lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - The standard interactive computing environemnt in data science/scientific computing
- [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) - image processing
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - data analysis library


One of the great things about all these libraries is that (unlike competing software like Matlab) is that they are all both [free and open-source](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html#mission-statement). Which, among other things, means you can continue to use them after you leave Harvard without paying for a license.

# Installing
By far the most convenient method for installing these and other scientific computing packages in python is by using the verision of python distributed by [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Make sure you download the version for Python 3.6 or higher as Python 2.7 will cease to be supported in ~1 year (https://pythonclock.org/) and there are some nice features we will use that  only availiable in Python 3.*.

# Starting JupyterLab
Please try to do this at least once before the first section meeting. In section, we will be happy to help address any problems you run into. 

## Windows
After you download this on Windows open the Anaconda Navigator. You should see a panel that says JupyterLab. Click this panel and it should open a tab in your default web browser. 


## Mac
Option 1: Launch the terminal application. At the command line type "jupyter lab" and press enter. This should open tab in your default browser.

Option 2: Open the Anaconda Navigator application. You will see a panel that says JupyterLab. Click this panel and it should open a tab in your default web browser.


## Linux
At the command line type "jupyter lab" and press enter. JupyterLab should open in a new tab in your default web browser

No matter what operating system you use, you should be in your internet browser in JupyterLab. Feel free to stop here but if you would like to experiment you can try to launch a new notebook and experiment with running some basic commands. You can also download the [homework instructions]() from github or canvas and opening it in jupyter lab.
