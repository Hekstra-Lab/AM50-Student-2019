# What to install
Install anaconda python 3.6 then install all the libraries in the next section.

https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

# What You'll need
Throughout this class we will be teaching you aspects of various scientific and numerical computing libraries in Python and using them to explore 

We will use the following libraries:
- [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) - library for scientific computing
- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) - for numerical computing (basis of all the other libraries here)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - plotting library
- [Jupyter lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - The standard interactive computing environemnt in data science/scientific computing
- [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) - image processing
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - data analysis library


One of the great things about all these libraries is that (unlike competing software like Matlab) is that they are all both [free and open-source](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html#mission-statement). Which, among other things, means you can continue to use them after you leave Harvard without paying for a license.

# Installing
By far the most convenient method for installing these and other scientific computing packages in python is by using the verision of python distributed by [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Make sure you download the version for Python 3.7 or higher as Python 2.7 will cease to be supported in ~1 year (https://pythonclock.org/) and there are some nice features we will use that  only availiable in Python 3.*.

After you download this on Windows or Mac open the Anaconda Navigator or linux go to your command line (terminal) and run the following commands:




If you don't want to take up that much space you can instead install [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) and manually install all the above packages. 

You are also welcome to use whatever python 3.x distribution you want and install the packages with pip.
conda install - conda-forge jupyterlab


# Operating Systems
Both Windows and Mac will be fine for this course, but if you would like to install a daul boot with a linux OS on your computer (read as: free yourself from the tyranny of windows update) then Ian will be happy to help you.
