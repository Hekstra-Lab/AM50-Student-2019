    "# (OPTIONAL) Problem 3 - Simulating the life of Hollywood actors\n",
    "It seems that movie directors sure like to go through the same list of actors all the time, with unknown actors not getting a shot nearly as much as you’d expect by chance. A concept in network analysis, _preferential attachment_, has been proposed to capture this notion in order to explain some features of small-world networks. In this problem we will explore different models for the probability of two actors costaring in a new movie and simulate the co-network based on these probability models. We have written the code that performs the simulations so all you need to provide the probability model $p_m(v)$ of actor $v$ being cast in movie $m$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To be explicit, the network we are considering will have nodes of actors with an edge between them if they have ever costarred in a movie. The adjacency matrix will describe this network, and at the beginning there will be no edges in the graph. We will then start to cast 10 actors to a movies one at a time, only updating the adjacency matrix after a movie is finished, with the movies also being cast one after the other. This will allow us to base the probability of an actor being cast into a movie on who has already been cast for that movie and the adjacency matrix. We can write this as:\n",

    "p_m(v|\\text{current cast}, \\text{adjacency matrix}) = ....\n",

    "We will assume that the probability that actor $v$ will get cast in movie $m$ is determined by two terms: a small probability to get picked at random, and a term proportional to how many other movies you have starred in ($n(v)$). That is, the probability : $p_m(v) \\propto n_0 + n(v)$. We will look at what the co-starring network looks like after $N_{movies} = 300$ movies, each casting 10 actors out of $N_{actors}=1000$ total.\n",
